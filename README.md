# App Analysis and Review
In this fun exercise, I go through the process of analyzing apps in the Google and Apple App Store, with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.

I conclude that taking a popular book (perhaps a classical novel in the public domain) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. This app might include features like daily quotes/audio snippets from the book in addition to quizzes and/or a forum where people can discuss the book.
